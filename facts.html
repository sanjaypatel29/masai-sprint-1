                        <p>How well do you understand rocket science? Well, fear no more: here are 24 bite-sized facts about an astronomically difficult science.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <h4>Rockets were first used as weapons.</h4>
                        <p>During the war between the Chinese empire and Mongol invaders, the Chinese devised a gunpowder-fueled arrow. The retreating Mongols described these projectiles as “arrows of flying fire.” These fire-arrows were the first solid-propellant rockets. From there, further experiments with cased gunpowder led to the development of military rockets and missiles.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <h4>Rocket power is measured in thrust.</h4>
                        <p>Rockets are self-propelling projectiles. Using up the fuel in the body, the rocket exhaust keeps it moving in the same trajectory. The force inside a rocket’s engine is called thrust. Since rockets weigh millions of kilograms, they must exert the same amount of force to propel itself through and out of the atmosphere.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <h4>The largest rocket is over 300 feet tall.</h4>
                        <p>Standing at 363 feet tall with a thrust of 7.6 million pounds, NASA’s Saturn 5 rocket is the largest one to date. The Saturn 5 was used for Lunar missions between the 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <h4>Rockets launch in 3 stages.</h4>
                        <p>Rockets aren’t one solid hunk of metal. If you’ve ever seen a rocket in space on cartoons or TV shows, you’d notice how it breaks apart. Essentially, a rocket breaks off into sections while in flight. The first stage of a rocket launch is ignition. From takeoff, the burning rocket exhaust will push the rocket forward. Once the fuel runs out, the section will break off. From there, the second stage fuel reserve will be used until the payload reaches orbit.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <h4>Rockets are loud.</h4>
                        <p>Rocket sound is so loud, it can destroy the rocket. When a space rocket is launched, acoustic waves can generate up to 180db of sound – which is almost as loud as a nuclear explosion. To avoid this, a sound suppressor system is built into the launch pad. The system uses water to absorb the sound waves from the rocket as it launches.</p>
