                <h4>When Were Rockets Invented?</h4>
                <p>The first known rockets were used in China in the 1200s. These solid rockets were used for fireworks.
                    They also were used by armies for war. In the 1300s, these rockets were used for the same purposes
                    through much of Asia and Europe. In the next 600 years, people developed bigger and better solid
                    rockets. Many of these were used by the military.

                    In 1903, a Russian teacher named Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote a paper describing the idea of
                    liquid-fuel rockets. In 1926, American scientist Robert Goddard flew the first liquid-fuel rocket.
                    German scientists led by Hermann Oberth improved liquid-fuel rockets. During World War II, Germany
                    used rockets to bomb other countries. In 1957, the Soviet Union used a rocket to launch the first
                    satellite. In 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin rode in a rocket to become the first person in
                    space. In 1969, the United States launched the first men to land on the moon - Neil Armstrong and
                    Buzz Aldrin - using a Saturn V rocket.</p>

                <h4>Fathers of rocketry</h4>
                <p>In the modern era, those who work in spaceflight today often acknowledge three “fathers of rocketry”
                    who helped push the first rockets into space. Only one of the three survived long enough to see
                    rockets being used for space exploration.

                    Russian Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935) published what is now known as the “rocket equation”
                    in 1903, in a Russian aviation magazine, according to NASA.The equation concerns relationships
                    between rocket speed and mass, as well as how fast the gas is leaving when it exits the propellant
                    system's exhaust and how much propellant there is. Tsiolkovsky also published a theory of multistage
                    rockets in 1929.

                    Robert Goddard (1882-1945) was an American physicist who sent the first liquid-fueled rocket aloft
                    in Auburn, Massachusetts, on March 16, 1926. He had two U.S. patents for using a liquid-fueled
                    rocket and also for a two- or three-stage rocket using solid fuel, according to NASA.

                    Hermann Oberth (1894-1989) was born in Romania and later moved to Germany. According to NASA, he
                    became interested in rocketry at an early age, and at age 14 he imagined a "recoil rocket" that
                    could move through space using nothing but its own exhaust. As an adult, his studies included
                    multistage rockets and how to use a rocket to escape Earth's gravity. His legacy is tainted by the
                    fact that he helped develop the V-2 rocket for Nazi Germany during World War II; the rocket was used
                    for devastating bombings on London. Oberth lived for decades after space exploration began and saw
                    rockets bring people all the way to the moon and watched the reusable space shuttle heft crews into
                    space again and again.</p>
