                <h1>What is a Rocket?</h1>
            </div>
            <div><br/>
                <p>The traditional definition of a rocket is a vehicle, missile or aircraft which obtains thrust by the
                    reaction to the ejection of fast moving fluid from within a rocket engine.

                    There are many different types of rockets, and a comprehensive list can be found in spacecraft
                    propulsion - they range in size from tiny models such as water rockets or small solid rockets that
                    can be purchased at a hobby store, to the enormous Saturn V used for the Apollo program.

                    Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (internal combustion engines) that emit an
                    exhaust gas.

                    A chemical rocket engine can use solid propellant (as does the Space Shuttle's SRBs), liquid
                    propellant (as does the Space shuttle main engine), or a hybrid mixture of both.

                    A chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and
                    the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the
                    rocket.

                    The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber
                    and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (in accordance with Newton's Third Law).</p>

                    <h4>How Does a Rocket Engine Work?</h4>
                <p>Like many other engines, a rocket produces thrust by burning fuel. Most rocket engines turn the fuel
                    into hot gas. Pushing the gas out of the back of the engine makes the rocket move forward.

                    A rocket is different from a jet engine. A jet engine requires oxygen from the air to work. A rocket
                    engine carries everything it needs. That is why a rocket engine works in space, where there is no
                    air.

                    There are two main types of rocket engines. Some rockets use liquid fuel. The main engines on the
                    space shuttle orbiter use liquid fuel. The Russian Soyuz uses liquid fuels. Other rockets use solid
                    fuels. On the side of the space shuttle are two white solid rocket boosters. They use solid fuels.
                    Fireworks and model rockets also fly using solid fuels.</p>

                    <h4>Why Does a Rocket Work?</h4>
                <p>In the vacuum of space, an engine has nothing to push against. So how do rockets move there? Rockets
                    work by a scientific rule called Newton's third law of motion. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton
                    listed three Laws of Motion more than 300 years ago. The third law says that for every action, there
                    is an equal and opposite reaction. When the rocket pushes out its exhaust, the exhaust also pushes
                    the rocket. The rocket pushes the exhaust backward. The exhaust makes the rocket move forward. This
                    rule can be seen on Earth. If a person stands on a skateboard and throws a bowling ball, the person
                    and the ball will move in opposite directions. Because the person is heavier, the bowling ball will
                    move farther.</p>
